Part 1
Input reading -- Adrian 
  Command line arguments
  Put initial board state into memory
Classes to store data -- Tianfang/Marc
  Board (H1 and H2)
    Keep track of number of nodes expanded.
    Keep track of effective branching factor
    Keep track of cost
    Keep track of moves
  Function to move 
Implementing the A* algorithm -- Adrian
Implementing the hill-climbing algorithm -- Tianfang

Note: Heuristic functions might be coupled closer to the Board class rather than the algorithm.

Part 2
Input reading -- Marc
  Command line arguments
  Storing of the map.
Class for map -- Marc/Adrian
  Map
    The score for this map
    Industrial, commercial, and residential sites marked.  
    Classes for different areas (residential, industrial, toxic, etc.)
    Make rules for points
Implementing the genetic algorithm  -- Marc
Implementing the hill-climbing algorithm  -- Tianfang
